#####   1. In this project, we will need to add code in api folder and website folder.

#####   2. In `api.py`, we will need to write code to handle parameters in different routes. Such like list data with filters `listAll`, `listOpenOnly` and `listCloseOnly`. 

#####   3. We will also write code to do more than that, like to specify whether display them in CSV or JSON.

#####   4. Will also let the user to specify how many lines of data to display by using top=k.

#####   5. As for the frontEnd webpage, I'll figure it out by using the extra day(s)
* You'll also design consumer programs (e.g., in jQuery) to use the service that you expose. `website` inside `DockerRestAPI` is an example of that. It is uses PHP. You're welcome to use either PHP or jQuery to consume your services. NOTE: your consumer program should be in a different container like example in `DockerRestAPI`.

## Known Issue(s):
###### 1. Fix the errors in the database;
###### 2. Run tests and then debug `app.py`
###### 3. Fifuring out and complete the front-end webpage
###### 4. Fix dockerfiles if necessary.
