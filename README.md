#####   1. In this project, we will need to add code in api folder and website folder.

#####   2. In `api.py`, we will need to write code to handle parameters in different routes. Such like list data with filters `listAll`, `listOpenOnly` and `listCloseOnly`. 

#####   3. We will also write code to do more than that, like to specify whether display them in CSV or JSON.

#####   4. Will also let the user to specify how many lines of data to display by using top=k.

### Progress(es) with my second commit (May 31, 2021):
##### 1. Fixed configuration files (ie. `dockerfiles`, `docker-configure.yml`)
##### 2. Added database drop methods to `flask_brevets.py` to drop the db before each running(adding).
##### 3. Added website services (ie. `website.py` and `website.html`) under `website` folder
##### 4. Eventually EVERYTHING SEEMS WORKS FINE


## Since I made it works in the last minute, I don't have time to add comments to the code. Might refine them in the future if I have time.
